# 👋 Hi, I'm Álvaro!

I am a passionate **computer science student** with a strong interest in **Front-End Web Development** and **data-driven applications**. As an enthusiastic learner, I am always eager to expand my skill set, embrace new challenges, and work on projects that have a meaningful impact. I thrive on exploring emerging technologies and crafting innovative solutions to real-world problems.

Currently, I am honing my skills in **Full-Stack Development** and **Data Visualization**, bridging my theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience through personal and academic projects. My goal is to create applications that are not only functional but also insightful and user-centric.
